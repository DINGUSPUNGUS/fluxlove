              <p>Every great story begins with curiosity. Mine started with a box of crayons and an endless imagination, doodling stories on every surface I could find.</p>
              <div class="story-details hidden">
                <p>From turning living room walls into my first gallery (much to my parents' surprise!) to creating elaborate storylines for my toys, creativity was never just a hobby‚Äîit was how I understood the world.</p>
                <ul class="story-highlights">
                  <li>First "masterpiece" at age 5 (a rainbow that somehow took up an entire wall)</li>
                  <li>Started writing and illustrating my own picture books</li>
                  <li>Discovered that every mundane object had a story waiting to be told</li>

              <h3>Finding My Voice</h3>
              <p>University opened doors to new worlds‚ÄîEconomics taught me to think strategically, Film Studies showed me how to tell compelling stories, and Philosophy challenged everything I thought I knew.</p>
              <div class="story-details hidden">
                <p>This is where I discovered the magic happens at intersections. Why choose between analytical thinking and creative expression when you can weave them together?</p>
                <ul class="story-highlights">
                  <li>Fell in love with the economics of creativity and storytelling</li>
                  <li>Made my first documentary that actually made people cry (happy tears!)</li>
                  <li>Realized that the best ideas come from connecting seemingly unrelated dots</li>
                  <li>Started seeing patterns everywhere‚Äîin market trends, in human behavior, in art</li>

              <h3>Strategy Meets Art</h3>
              <p>The professional world tried to put me in a box‚Äî"Are you creative or strategic?" But the most interesting work happens when you refuse to choose and create your own category instead.</p>
              <div class="story-details hidden">
                <p>I discovered that the best campaigns, the most memorable brands, and the most effective communication all have one thing in common: they tell authentic stories that connect with real people.</p>
                <ul class="story-highlights">
                  <li>Developed campaigns that didn't just sell products, but told stories people wanted to share</li>
                  <li>Learned that data and emotion aren't opposites‚Äîthey're best friends</li>
                  <li>Built my reputation as the person who brings both left-brain logic and right-brain magic</li>
                  <li>Started helping brands find their authentic voice in a noisy world</li>

              <h3>The Adventure Continues</h3>
              <p>Right now, I'm living at the sweet spot where strategy meets creativity, where data informs intuition, and where every project is a chance to tell a story that matters.</p>
              <div class="story-details hidden">
                <p>I wake up every day excited to solve problems through creative thinking, whether that's developing a campaign that changes how people think about sustainability or creating art that makes someone's day a little brighter.</p>
                <ul class="story-highlights">
                  <li>Currently working on projects that blend film, data visualization, and social impact</li>

            <h3>Authenticity Over Everything</h3>
            <p>In a world full of filters and facades, genuine storytelling cuts through the noise. I believe the most powerful work comes from real experiences, honest emotions, and authentic voices.</p>
            <div class="philosophy-example">
              <strong>In practice:</strong> My campaigns don't just look pretty‚Äîthey reflect real human truths that resonate long after the scroll.

            <h3>Stories Build Bridges</h3>
            <p>Every piece of content is an opportunity to create connection. Whether it's a brand campaign or a personal film, I'm always asking: "How can this bring people together?"</p>
            <div class="philosophy-example">
              <strong>In practice:</strong> I design experiences that make people feel seen, understood, and part of something bigger.

            <div class="philosophy-example">
              <strong>In practice:</strong> I'm always experimenting‚Äîfrom AI-assisted storytelling to traditional film techniques that are making a comeback.
