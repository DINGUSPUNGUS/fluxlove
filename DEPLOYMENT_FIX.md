# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Issue
The portfolio site was not loading on Vercel because the main content was in the `src` folder, but Vercel was looking for files in the root directory.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Created Root Index.html âœ…
- Added a new `index.html` at the root level
- Updated all CSS and JS paths to point to `src/` folder
- Updated navigation links to use correct relative paths (`src/pages/`)

### 2. Fixed Navigation Paths âœ…
- Updated all page navigation to point to `../../index.html` for home
- Fixed logo links to use correct relative paths
- Maintained internal page navigation structure

### 3. Updated Package.json âœ…
- Changed start script to serve from root instead of src
- Kept dev script to serve from src for development

### 4. Added Deployment Configuration âœ…
- Created `.vercelignore` to exclude unnecessary files
- Simplified `vercel.json` configuration
- Added proper build instructions

### 5. Tested Locally âœ…
- Verified root index.html loads correctly
- Tested navigation between pages
- Confirmed all assets (CSS, JS, videos) load properly

## File Structure Now
```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html (NEW - Root homepage)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.html (Original homepage)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/ (All portfolio pages)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ css/ (Stylesheets)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ js/ (JavaScript)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ assets/ (Videos, PDFs, images)
â”œâ”€â”€ vercel.json (Simplified)
â”œâ”€â”€ .vercelignore (NEW)
â””â”€â”€ package.json (Updated)
```

## Next Steps
1. Push changes to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Vercel
3. Site should now load correctly at your domain

## URLs Working
- `/` - Homepage (root index.html)
- `/src/pages/videos-new.html` - Films page
- `/src/pages/music-new.html` - Music page
- `/src/pages/poetry-new.html` - Writing page
- All other portfolio pages accessible from navigation

The site is now properly configured for Vercel deployment! ðŸš€
